# Install missing packages for MacOS
The easiest way to install ffmpeg is with [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/).  
Once done, you need to install the following package: `ffmpeg`

    brew install ffmpeg

after `ffmpeg` was installed, change your shell to use `zsh`. type in the terminal:

    chsh -s /bin/zsh

> this is just a temporary fix
